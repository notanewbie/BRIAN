# BRIAN
a Bot Really Intelligent And Nice

This piece of software is a chatbot programmed in Python. It's easy to use. Unfortunately I am no longer bug testing this for Mac, but it should still work. I continually bug test this for Windows 10, and occaisionally for Windows XP.

It saves one kind of file: .ph, Phrase Files. They tell my software what to say.
It also saves two folders: the PH folder and the DB folder. The PH folder contains .ph files. The content of the file is how to reply to a certain phrase, and the name specifies what phrase it's replying to. The DB folder is similar, but the name a content match. It's an exhaustive database of everything anybody's told it.

The 2018 release of BRIAN is finally here! Now, there is a settings file settings.pts, which lets you determine the bot's name and whether or not it will update automatically. Also, a new algorithm has been deployed, causing more realistic responses than before when BRIAN doesn't understand how to respond to what was spoken.

Please note: BRIAN requires Python 2.7.x
