# BRIAN
a Bot Really Intelligent And Nice

This piece of software is a chatbot programmed in Python. It's easy to use; however, it is also unbugtested for Windows, as I have not finished bug testing this code for Windows yet, so this might be fairly unstable. Bug-testing help would be appreciated, as I am kinda busy. However, it is nearly 100% stable for Mac.

It saves one kind of file: .ph, Phrase Files. They tell my software what to say.
It also saves two folders: the PH folder and the DB folder. The PH folder contains .ph files. The content of the file is how to reply to a certain phrase, and the name specifies what phrase it's replying to. The DB folder is similar, but the name a content match. It's an exhaustive database of everything anybody's told it.

After bug-testing and working on this for quite a while, I will soon release the 2018 edition of BRIAN! It will now work without a pre-installed database, you to create new AIs with seperate responses. It also includes some stability fixes for Windows as well as optimization. 

Please note: BRIAN requires Python 2.7.x
